# My ckeditor branch

My branch of ckeditor, which contains some customizations that I find useful.

In particular, the imgblob plugin, which allows auto-uploading of images to the app engine blobstore.

All of the plugins and stuff are the defaults, so after checking this out, just run:

    ./dev/builder/build.sh

to build.
